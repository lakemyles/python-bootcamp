# Functions and Code Blocks/Indentation

# Define a function
# Everything indented after colon is part of function
# Function definitions are not hoisted and
# have to be called after function definition
# def my_function():
#     print("Hello")
#     print("Bye")
#     print("hi")


# # iterate 6 times
# for step in range(6):
#     print(step)

# iterate 6 times
# i = 0
# while 6 > i:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1

# Infinite loop
# while True:
#     print("INFINITY AND BEYOND")
